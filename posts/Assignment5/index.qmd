![Shiny app demo](/posts/Assignment6/image.png)

**Objective:** The goal of the Shiny app is to perform sentiment analysis on user-entered text using a custom AFINN dataset. It provides interactive visualizations, specifically bar and pie charts, to represent the sentiment scores and distribution of the entered text.

**Components:**

1.  **Dashboard Layout:**

    -   The dashboard consists of a header with the title "Sentiment Analysis App."

    -   The sidebar menu includes a "Charts" option.

2.  **Charts Tab:**

    -   The "Charts" tab includes the following components:

        -   A header "Sentiment Analysis Charts."

        -   A text input field labeled "Enter Text" for users to input the text they want to analyze.

        -   A bar chart displaying the sentiment score based on the AFINN data. The chart title is "Sentiment Score Bar Chart," and the y-axis is labeled "Sentiment Score."

        -   A pie chart illustrating the sentiment distribution of the entered text. The chart title is "Sentiment Score Pie Chart."

**Functionality:**

-   Users can input text in the provided text input field.

-   The app calculates the sentiment score based on the AFINN data for the entered text.

-   The sentiment score is visually represented in both a bar chart and a pie chart.

-   The bar chart shows the overall sentiment score, and the pie chart depicts the distribution of positive and negative sentiments.

**Usage:**

-   Users can enter any text in the input field to see the corresponding sentiment analysis charts.

-   The charts dynamically update based on the entered text, providing an interactive and real-time sentiment analysis experience.

**Note:**

-   The app utilizes the AFINN data, which is a pre-defined list of words with associated sentiment scores.

-   The code assumes the existence of an AFINN data file named "afinn_data.csv."
